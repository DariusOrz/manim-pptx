# manim-pptx
An addon for [3b1b/manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) that generates a PowerPoint presentation from a scene

## Usage
Since the addon API is still in development, make sure to use a version of `manim` supporting the [proposed API](https://github.com/3b1b/manim/pull/609).

To install the addon, place the `pptx_addon.py` script and associated folders from this repository (e.g. `templates`) in the directory `[path to manim root]/addons/pptx_addon`.
