# manim-pptx
An addon for [3b1b/manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) that generates a PowerPoint presentation from a scene

## Installation
* Make sure that the `manimlib` package is installed.
    * Since this tool uses [a proposed add-on API](https://github.com/3b1b/manim/pull/609), you currently have to build manim from [this fork](https://github.com/yoshiask/manim).
* Run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install the additional dependencies.
