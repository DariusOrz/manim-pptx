# manim-pptx
An addon for [3b1b/manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim) that generates a PowerPoint presentation from a scene

## Usage
Since the addon API is still in development, make sure to use a version of `manim` supporting the [proposed API](https://github.com/3b1b/manim/pull/609).

To install the addon, copy the `pptx_exporter` folder into `[path to manim]/addons/pptx_addon`.
